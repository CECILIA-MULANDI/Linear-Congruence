# Linear-Congruence

Linear congruence is a type of equation in number theory that takes the form:

ax≡b (mod m)

Here’s a breakdown of the components:

    a: A given integer (coefficient of x).
    x: The unknown variable we want to solve for.
    b: A given integer (the remainder or the result).
    m: The modulus, a positive integer.
